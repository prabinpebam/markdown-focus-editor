I need the following web app, html, css and js.
- It's a markdown text editor with markdown syntax highlighted to reflect bold, italics etc but not colors and font size.
- I have an option to go full screen
- It should have a plain light grey background
- It should have 3 modes
-- Line focus mode: Only the sentence where the cursor is currently is shown with rgba(0,0,0,1), rest everything is rgba(0,0,0,0.6)
-- Paragraph focus mode: Only the paragraph where the cursor is currently is shown with rgba(0,0,0,1), rest everything is rgba(0,0,0,0.6)
-- Full view: All text is shown with rgba(0,0,0,1)
-- I should have an option to increase/decrease overall font size.
- When I click save (ctrl+s), the complete text should be saved as a md file.
- I should be able to drag and drop or upload any text or md file directly to open the file in this editor.
- All of the functionalities should be in a hidden toolbar that can be open by clicking the hamburger menu icon on the top left corner.
- This toolbar will have, Save, Open, Increase/decrease font size, light mode/dark mode, go full screen/exit full screen, change modes - Line, paragraph, full, change font
- Option to browse and change font
-- Open modal to select font from list.
-- Load list of google fonts, show preview and give option to select a font which will be applied to the editor.

Come up with sensible dark mode colors and have option for dark mode. All focus modes should work properly in dark mode also.

Use google font. Use Roboto Mono font as default.
